# I Got 99 Problems But Scala Ain't One

Source: [S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)

These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland. 
[Phil Gold](http://aperiodic.net/phil/) has altered them to be more 
amenable to 
programming in 
Scala.
